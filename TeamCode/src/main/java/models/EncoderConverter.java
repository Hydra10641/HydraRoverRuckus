    /* LINEAR CONVERTER DESCRIPTION:
     *
     * The encoder of the "REV core hex motor" has the fractional rotation in 288 parts. so if we want a rotation,
     * we have to multiply it by 288:
     *
     * converted value = rotation * 288
     *
     * But, before we pass the amount of rotation, we have to convert the distance in centimeters to rotations.
     * To do this, it's simple, we will divide the desired distance by the circumference of the wheel and multiply by
     * the ratio of gears:
     *
     * rotation = distance desired * distance between wheels (diameter) * PI * gear ratio.

    /* ANGULAR CONVERTER DESCRIPTION:
     *
     * The definition of rotation in this mode is different, since we will convert an arc to rotations,
     * we will take into account the angle (ATTENTION: this converter is only for curves in the axis of rotation of the robot).
     * However, the definition of converted value remains the same.
     * This time we will use the principle of proportion. We will compare the ratio between the requested angle and the angle
     * of a circle (360Â°), with the ratio of the desired arc to the circumference of the robot (we will write a circle with the
     * distance between wheels as diameter). So it will look like this:
     *
     * angle X/360 = arc desired/ robot circumference.
     *
     * How we want to convert the arc to rotations:
     *
     * arc desired = robot circunference * angle X / 360.
     *
     * Deriving to fit our attributes, and add the gear ratio:
     *
     * arc desired = (distance between wheel * PI ) * gear ratio * angle X/ 360.
